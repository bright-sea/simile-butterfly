  What is this?
  -------------

  Butterfly is a modular web application framework.



  How do I use it?
  ----------------
  
  Type
  
    $ ./butterfly
  
  and then pointing your browser to 
  
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/
   
  where you should see a Butterfly welcome page. 



  Where is the stuff that Butterfly is showing me?
  ------------------------------------------------
  
  Butterfly's main concept is webapp modules. By default, modules are 
  located in 
  
   ./modules/
   
  and wired together with information contained in the file named

   ./modules.properties  
   
  those two together should give you hints on how to start looking around for 
  what Butterfly does.



  Is there any other documentation?
  ---------------------------------
  
  Point your browser to 

     http://code.google.com/p/simile-butterfly/

  to go to the official Butterfly home page.
   


  What's with the Maven poms?
  ---------------------------
  
  They're there so the Butterfly engine can be published in
  Maven Central.  They're not useful for you unless you're
  involved in the Maven deployment process and have no bearing
  on the build process.  You can safely ignore them.
